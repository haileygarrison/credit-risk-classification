# credit-risk-classification
### Overview
I am training and assessing a model based on loan risk. Using historical lending data to train and test a model that identifies the creditworthiness of borrowers.

### Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
- Accuracy: 0.9442676901753825
- Precision: array([[18679,    80],[   67,   558]])
- Recall scores of model: 0: 1.00, 1: 0.89

### Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data
- Accuracy: 0.9959744975744975
- Precision: array([[18668,    91],[    2,   623]])
- Recall scores of model: 0: 1.00, 1: 1.00

<!-- Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you donâ€™t recommend the model, justify your reasoning. (10 points) -->
### Summary
Between the two models, the logistic regression model using resampled data preformed best. I would recomment using the Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data
